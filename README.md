## Site 1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc-pL5Gpn3g
I google christchurch /New Zealand
I have a tendency of going to Youtube for most searhes.The video seemed nice geared towards older and family vacations.
Its a video and quite simple to navigate.You can scroll down and read and make comments.
I like the site and its very interesting for me.This was a well made video .Very impressed
Criticism is fine just prefer not so many silly comments/or going off topic for attention.

## Site https://www.aboutaustralia.com/itineraries/st-3489-the-best-of-new-zealand-vacation/
I followed this link from the Youtube site
Site looks ok a little dated interactive buttons and icons are big and have that gradient shadow .Type is spaced out inconsistant
Its helpful just a little bland.If I was going on a vacation i know that it would help me get started
There are videos to watch
I would be ok if I couldnt find the site,theres all kinds like this one
Just needs a up to date feel.It would not direct me to another site

## Site 3https://torontoscubacentre.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI28Tmp8aB4AIVpB6tBh15MwGLEAAYASAAEgIEHPD_BwE
googled scuba diving
The site looks great /video of aquatic life is the best.
Very modern site/and quite informative /I highly recommend this site
So much information on diving and how to start off.
They give pricing and its up front even though its expensive
Maybe change type size and style /play around with the background color/Did not refer to any other sites.

## Site 4https://floatnflag.com/learn-to-scuba-dive/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIm9qO3smB4AIVUxx9Ch2eSAW-EAAYASAAEgKE2fD_BwE
Googled searched scuba diving St Catharines
Site looks good very clinical and to the point /its a certification site.Dive shop
It offers up training and presents a video of diving.I think visually it does a good job.
It opened my eyes to how expensive diving would be.
I would change the store set up/just find it off center.
Would not refer to another site.
